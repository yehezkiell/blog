Have you noticed when you take a picture on your smartphone and upload/share it to social media like Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. Usually before sending it to the remote server, the quality of the original image is reduced but not so much and still negligible to the naked eye to get a clear picture of the whole image?.
This is my first blog post! Isn't it _great_?
Some of my **favorite** things are:

<Announcement type="asd" className="mt-4">

If the product is variant, it will most likely the product `js const Div = styled.div`
only has one of the restriction type (cannot combine of each other). But it can be each variant has different eligibility though, for example variant a is restricted by shop followers while variant b is not.

- Petting dogs
- Singing
- Eating potato-based foods

Have you noticed when you take a picture on your smartphone and upload/share `white-space: pre sadas dasd asd as.` it to social media `white-space: pre.` like Telegram, Instagram,
WhatsApp, etc. Usually before sending it to the remote server, the quality of the
original image is reduced but not so much and still negligible to the naked eye to
get a clear picture of the whole image?.

```js
const Div = styled.div
width: 500px;
max-width: 100%;
background-color: white;
margin: 0 auto;
position: fixed;
left: 50%;
top: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
padding: 10px 20px 40px;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;;

```

I can highlight `css>-.some-class { background-color: red }` with CSS syntax.

```shell
echo a
```

```java
public void asd(Context context) {

}
```

```kotlin
fun asd() : String{  var a = "123"  var a = "123"  var a = "123"  var a = "123"
    var a = "123"
}
```

```py
a = 1
b = {}
```
